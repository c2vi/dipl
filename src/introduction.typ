// ask an LLM


= A look at existing software platforms
// Operating systems are software platforms.... take a look at android, Windows, Ubuntu, the apple platform with all their kits
// the Filesystem apis are well established... but were developed in the early days of computing... where end users only had one computer... so no syncing of data was needed ..... nowadays however everybody has many computing devices .... laptop, smartTV, smartphone, smartwatch, and i don't even wanna start on all the smarthome and IoT thigns.


// efi and BIOS are platforms


// glfw and SDL are platforms focused on making portable apps in an easy way


// QT is also one... it has many platform abstractions... like QsendNotification and so on...


// the rust standard library can be sort of a platform.... it gives you things like fileIO APIs (that work on all operating systems)



= The idea of the mize platform <idea-of-mize>

// every running code needs to deal with data somehow.....

// and in modern connected times it is expected to do so across multiple devices...




== The Data Engine

== The Gui Engine

== The Command Engine

== The Init and Option Engine
// include that???
