The Idea of Mize was everything but immediate, it evolved over about 4 years. First thoughts about something like that came to mind shortly after learning to programm with python in first class of the HTL. This history is documented in this section.

When learning to code you may have the problem, that you forget all the names of functions, modules, concepts and even the names of keywords. And also what they do. So to help with that I wanted to make an application, where I could put all those things and look them up, when needed by search. All those items would have a type, eg: keyword, python-imternal-function, python-module, .... Later it was realised, that also all "documentation items" from other languages and frameworks could be added to such a searchable system and work on a "personal db" was also started, where personal notes, quotes and anythinge else, after a type for it would be added.

The implementation of this predecessor of Mize, never become close to being usable. I gave up when I couldn't get html forms to work, this was a struggle due to a lack of understanding for HTTP and networking in general. The source code was later uploaded to github for the purpose of documenting the history of Mize.
